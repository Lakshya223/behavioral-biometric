# Behavioral-Biometric

This project was created in preparation for the Bank of Baroda Hackathon 2022.The aim of this project is to provide a neuro-physiological approach to continuously authenticate the user using keystroke dynamics and recognising other behavioural patterns. Keystroke dynamics can be used to analyse how users type and interact by measuring various aspects of keyboard input gestures. Our project considers various machine learning and deep learning techniques like CNN and RNN based on free-text keystroke features.

This repository will constantly be updated during the course of the hackathon.
